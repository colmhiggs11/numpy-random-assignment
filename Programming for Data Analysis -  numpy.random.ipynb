    "* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a numerical Python library that uses arrays to allow calculations to be completed on lists of data by converting them to arrays. Multplying matrices is an example of the calculations that numpy can deal with that would otherwise be extremely difficult to write code for. Numpy is used in many forms the main ones being file compressions, analysing datasets and as mentioned performing calculations of matrix operations that would not be possible to complete on lists. \n",

    "\n",
    "    Generators - Generators are used to create iterators, but with a different approach. Generators are simple functions which return an iterable set of items, one at a time, in a special way. When an iteration over a set of item starts using the for statement, the generator is run. Once the generator's function code reaches a \"yield\" statement, the generator yields its execution back to the for loop, returning a new value from the set. The generator function can generate as many values (possibly infinite) as it wants, yielding each one in its turn. \n",
