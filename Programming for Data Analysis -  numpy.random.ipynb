Multiplying matrices is an example of the calculations that numpy can deal with that would otherwise be extremely difficult to write code for. Numpy is used in many forms the main ones being file compressions, analysing datasets and as mentioned performing calculations of matrix operations that would not be possible to complete on lists. \n",

    "Numpy.random uses Generators and Bit Generators to generate Pseudo random numbers. Generators use sequences of bits created by the Bit Generator and convert them into sequences of numbers that are sampled from probability distributions. In the new version of Numpy the Generator is compatible with numerous Bit Generators that allow more probability distributions to be sampled. Pseudo Random Number Generators are algorithms that produce an array of numbers that seem random but are actually generated from mathematical formulas. They are ideal for testing code or modelling as if you use a seed number for the initial starting point you will return the same number each time. True random numbers are required for data encryption and gambling. The table below shows the type of random numbers suitable for each application.\n",
