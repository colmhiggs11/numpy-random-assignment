Once the generator's function code reaches a \"yield\" statement, the generator yields its execution back to the for loop, returning a new value from the set.

When discussing single numbers, a random number is one that is drawn from a set of possible values, each of which is equally probable, i.e., a uniform distribution. https://www.random.org/randomness/\n",
    "    There are two main approaches to generating random numbers using a computer: Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs). The approaches have quite different characteristics and each has its pros and cons.\n",
